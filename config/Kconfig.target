config REMASTER_SUFFIX
  string "Suffix to append to remastered ISO file"
  default "gnuradio-3.7.10.1"
  help

    Choose a string to be appended to the ISO file name to distinguish
    the binary from the original stock image ISO.

    If in question leave this at the default.

config ENCRYPT_ROOTFS
  bool "Encrypt root filesystem"
  default n
  help

    Enabling this option will replace the compressed root-filesystem
    with an encrypted LUKS container. During build of the image, you
    will be prompted for a decryption passphrase (3 times).  During
    operation, you will be required to enter this passphrase, and the
    root filesystem will be automatically decrypted and decompressed
    on-the-fly as needed.

    If in question, say no here.

config ISO_UEFI
  bool "Create UEFI-compatible ISO image (EXPERIMENTAL)"
  depends on EXPERIMENTAL
  default n
  help

    Enable this to add an El-Torito alternate boot record pointing at
    an EFI boot loader image inside the ISO file.  This is
    experimental and not known to reliably work.
